## Thought process 
The mail address seemed legit and the same goes for the MTA used to send the mail.
I've used [EML analyzer](https://eml-analyzer.herokuapp.com/) and it didnt return anything suspicious.
Nothing seems wrong after visualizing the mail in thunderbird.
But by doing a bit of reseearch I've learned that mails could be sent from paypal servers with a legit mail address 
and it could still be phishing if there's a wrong phone number in the mail for example.
